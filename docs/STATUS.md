# Status

## Current stage

Offline application shell (TASK-005 Block 4.1).

## Completed

- Defined product idea.
- Defined MVP scope.
- Created initial architecture.
- Created project documentation.
- Connected GitHub repository.
- Defined Codex workflow.
- Completed TASK-001: iOS offline video storage spike.
- Completed TASK-002: production bootstrap with Next.js web app, FastAPI API, PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, Docker Compose, health checks and an empty reversible Alembic migration.
- Implemented TASK-003: videos table, MinIO adapter, idempotent MP4 seed, video list and Backend API streaming with single HTTP Range support.
- Implemented TASK-004: HMAC-signed keyset pagination for `GET /videos`, deterministic batch MP4 seed, and a native scroll-snap multi-video feed with muted autoplay, shared sound state and incremental loading.

## Current focus

TASK-005 Block 4.1 implementation is awaiting repeated production manual smoke: the production Next.js application uses one Serwist Service Worker at `/serwist/sw.js` with scope `/`. Its application shell precaches build assets and adds the literal `/offline` fallback target with a deterministic revision. Registration is supplied once by `SerwistProvider`, and `reloadOnOnline=false` avoids online-triggered reloads. Backend API responses, video streams and the local `offline-reels-media-v1` cache remain outside Service Worker caching.

## Next step

Continue TASK-005 with Block 4.2: serve cached MP4 through `/offline-media/{videoId}` with HTTP Range support, replacing the temporary Blob URL adapter. Then validate application-shell reload, media playback, storage quotas and long sessions on a real iPhone.

## Recent decisions

Added:
- Technical decisions documentation.
- Technical risks documentation.
- Изолированный React/Vite PWA spike в `spikes/ios-offline-storage`.
- Cache Storage для тестового MP4 и IndexedDB только для успешно сохранённых метаданных.
- Автоматические тесты ключевой логики spike и инструкция по ручной проверке на iPhone.
- На iPhone подтверждено удаление тестового видео: оно не возвращается после перезапуска PWA.
- В интерфейсе разделены точный размер готовых видео и приблизительное origin-wide использование browser storage.
- TASK-001 пройден на iPhone 16 Pro с iOS 26.5.2 и 44,2 ГБ свободного места: видео размером 13 864 238 байт сохранилось после перезапуска PWA и воспроизвелось в авиарежиме.
- Для MVP принят подход: Cache Storage для видео и IndexedDB для метаданных готовых видео.
- Reproducible Docker Compose bootstrap added: Node.js 24.14.0/Next.js web app and Python 3.14.3/FastAPI API with PostgreSQL, Redis and MinIO.
- API exposes `/health/live` (FastAPI process only), `/health/ready` (PostgreSQL and Redis only), and independent `/health/minio` diagnostics.
- Alembic has an empty, reversible initial migration; Instagram collection, downloads, authentication, feed logic, Celery and production offline caching remain unimplemented.
- Web dependency security triage updated Vitest to 4.1.10 and removed its critical development-only advisory. The moderate PostCSS advisory remains open through Next.js 16.2.10's nested PostCSS 8.4.31; no unsafe audit fix or Next.js downgrade was applied.
- TASK-003 streams video through Backend API rather than presigned storage URLs. Integration tests use isolated PostgreSQL and MinIO infrastructure.
- TASK-003 was validated end-to-end: idempotent seed uploaded the 13,864,238-byte spike MP4, `/videos` returned one record, HTTP streaming returned `200` and `206`, multipart Range returned `416`, and the video remained available after `make down`/`make up`.
- TASK-004 uses `created_at DESC, id DESC` keyset pagination with an HMAC-SHA-256 signed opaque cursor. The cursor secret is required at runtime and never belongs in Git.
- TASK-004 keeps loaded video elements mounted while validating native scroll-snap UX. To avoid Chromium open-ended Range downloads from every mounted element, only the active player and its next neighbor receive stream URLs; all remaining cards stay mounted without a source. Full DOM virtualization remains a future real-device performance task.
- The active-player selection retains the latest `IntersectionObserver` ratio for every feed card, resolves ties by the feed center, and has a requestAnimationFrame-throttled scroll fallback for browsers that emit only partial observer callback batches.
- Real Instagram Reels passed the manual TASK-004 feed smoke scenario in Chrome and Yandex Browser. The earlier issue was limited to some third-party test MP4 encodings, not pagination, active-player selection, the media window, Range streaming or the Backend API. A future ingestion task must define media validation and, if needed, normalization or transcoding for a safe MVP format; no transcoding was added to TASK-004.
- TASK-005 Block 1 adds the versioned `offline-reels` IndexedDB schema and `offline-reels-media-v1` media cache behind typed browser-only adapters. Reconciliation marks stale or invalid local records failed and removes orphan cache entries; Block 2 builds on this foundation.
- TASK-005 Block 2 adds a one-at-a-time, explicitly user-started local download queue. It passes one Backend stream through `TransformStream` directly to an owned Cache Storage response, avoiding `ReadableStream.tee()` and downloader response cloning. Progress is in-memory only; IndexedDB receives `0` at start and the verified final byte count only on completion. Downloads do not auto-resume after reload or network restoration; abort and quota failures pause the queue. Service Worker, `/offline`, cached-media Range delivery and offline playback are still not implemented.
- TASK-005 Block 3.1 separates reusable vertical playback UI from the online data layer. `VerticalVideoFeed` receives typed items and media URLs, exposes optional actions and active-item callbacks, and retains the observer/rAF selection and two-source media window. `VideoList` still owns online requests, cursor pagination and local-download controls; `/offline` is not implemented.
- TASK-005 Block 3.2 adds `/offline` as a local-only completed-video catalog with an exact library-size summary and approximate origin usage/quota. The temporary Cache Storage-to-Blob URL adapter is constrained to the active-plus-next playback window and always revokes its URLs. It is not a Service Worker replacement: offline reload and cached HTTP Range responses remain unimplemented.
- The Block 2 downloader uses `fetch(..., { cache: "no-store" })`. The API CORS policy therefore explicitly permits `Cache-Control` in addition to `Range`, as well as `GET` and `HEAD`, for the configured `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`; it exposes the media response headers needed by the downloader. This keeps the origin allowlist explicit and does not enable credentials or wildcards.
- TASK-005 Block 4.1 adds a Turbopack-compatible Serwist application shell. `@serwist/turbopack`, `serwist` and native `esbuild` build exactly one dynamically served worker at `/serwist/sw.js`; `SerwistProvider` registers it at scope `/` only in production. The Turbopack glob manifest contains only static assets, not the literal Next route `/offline`, so the worker adds `/offline` explicitly with a deterministic SHA-256 revision derived from offline-shell build inputs. The offline navigation fallback is intentionally restricted to `/offline`; API, streams and media are not runtime-cached. Serwist shell-cache cleanup only targets its precache names and leaves `offline-reels-media-v1` untouched.

## Current open questions

- Exact synchronization strategy.
- Instagram session management.
- Media delivery architecture.
- Долгосрочная сохранность Cache Storage/IndexedDB и поведение при ограничении квоты iOS.

# Risk 1: iOS PWA storage limitations

## Problem

Browser storage on iOS may have limitations.
The system can restrict available storage or remove cached data.

## Impact

Users may lose prepared offline videos.

This directly affects the main product value.

## Mitigation

Before finalizing storage architecture:
- test on real iOS devices;
- measure available storage;
- verify Cache Storage and IndexedDB behavior;
- define cleanup strategy.

## Status

Open.

# Risk 2: Background synchronization limitations

## Problem

PWA applications cannot guarantee background execution when closed.

## Impact

The application cannot rely on automatic background downloads.

## Mitigation

Design synchronization as resumable:
- server prepares content independently;
- client downloads when opened;
- interrupted downloads can continue.

## Status

Open.

# Risk 3: Instagram automation instability

## Problem

Instagram automation may break because of:
- UI changes;
- expired sessions;
- CAPTCHA;
- rate limits;
- account restrictions.

## Impact

The system may stop collecting new Reels.

## Mitigation

- isolate Instagram Collector;
- implement clear error handling;
- store session status;
- make collector replaceable.

## Status

Open.

# Risk 4: Video storage and synchronization complexity

## Problem

Large video files require careful handling.

Potential issues:
- storage limits;
- duplicate downloads;
- interrupted transfers;
- outdated files.

## Mitigation

Implement:
- file validation;
- download states;
- retry mechanisms;
- storage cleanup policies.

## Status

Open.

# Risk 5: Synchronization conflicts

## Problem

The system needs to define behavior when:
- user watches videos offline;
- multiple devices are used;
- local state conflicts with server state.

## Mitigation

Define synchronization rules before production implementation.

## Status

Open.

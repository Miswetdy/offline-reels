# Risk 1: iOS PWA storage limitations

## Problem

Browser storage on iOS may have limitations.
The system can restrict available storage or remove cached data.

## Impact

Users may lose prepared offline videos.

This directly affects the main product value.

## Mitigation

The baseline offline flow was confirmed on an iPhone 16 Pro running iOS 26.5.2: a 13,864,238-byte video survived a PWA restart and played in Airplane Mode. Deletion also persisted across restart.

The following risks remain open:
- iOS can still evict origin data under storage pressure or according to its storage policy;
- behavior near the storage quota has not been measured;
- the capacity and performance of storing a large number of videos have not been measured;
- a cleanup policy is still required before production implementation.

## Status

Partially mitigated: basic offline storage behavior is confirmed; quota, eviction, and large-library behavior remain open.

# Risk 2: Background synchronization limitations

## Problem

PWA applications cannot guarantee background execution when closed.

## Impact

The application cannot rely on automatic background downloads.

## Mitigation

Design synchronization as resumable:
- server prepares content independently;
- client downloads when opened;
- interrupted downloads can continue.

## Confirmed limitation

The PWA offline flow works after the user opens the app, but the experiment does not provide or rely on background synchronization while the PWA is closed. Background downloads and synchronization must remain resumable and user-initiated when the app is opened.

## Status

Open.

# Risk 3: Instagram automation instability

## Problem

Instagram automation may break because of:
- UI changes;
- expired sessions;
- CAPTCHA;
- rate limits;
- account restrictions.

## Impact

The system may stop collecting new Reels.

## Mitigation

- isolate Instagram Collector;
- implement clear error handling;
- store session status;
- make collector replaceable.

## Status

Open.

# Risk 4: Video storage and synchronization complexity

## Problem

Large video files require careful handling.

Potential issues:
- storage limits;
- duplicate downloads;
- interrupted transfers;
- outdated files.

## Mitigation

Implement:
- file validation;
- download states;
- retry mechanisms;
- storage cleanup policies.

## Status

Open.

---

# Risk 5: Synchronization conflicts

## Problem

The system needs to define behavior when:
- user watches videos offline;
- multiple devices are used;
- local state conflicts with server state.

## Mitigation

Define synchronization rules before production implementation.

## Status

Open.

# Risk 6: PostgreSQL and object storage are not one transaction

## Problem

Creating a video requires an object in MinIO and a metadata record in PostgreSQL. These systems do not share an atomic transaction.

## Mitigation

TASK-003 creates or verifies the object first and then upserts metadata by the deterministic object key. Repeating the seed repairs a missing object or missing database record without creating duplicates.

## Remaining limitation

If PostgreSQL fails after a successful upload, an orphan object can remain. Automatic orphan cleanup is outside TASK-003. If an object is deleted after metadata exists, the streaming endpoint returns the safe `video_object_not_found` error without exposing storage internals.

## Status

Accepted limitation for the first vertical slice.
